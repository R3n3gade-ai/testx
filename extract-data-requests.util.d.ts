 * You can use this function for prefetch chart data optimization on initial loading.
 * The request to data provider is made only after chart initialization (1-2 seconds),
 * so in this case you might want to request data from server in advance.
 * However, your data provider must implement caching mechanism, because when the chart will be initialized
 * it will call the data provider for the data which should be already cached.
 * @usage example:
 * const requests = extractDataRequests(layout)
 * requests.forEach(r => data.requestHistoryData(r.symbol, r.aggregation, r.options)
 * returns array of data requests for the current layout
 * @param layout - chart react widget layout which is typically supplied to chart's layout provider
